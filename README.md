# rust-rocket-mongodb
Rust Rocket API for MongoDB with CORS added.  Based on MongoDB-endorsed example.

This is the first version, without unit tests or comments.

CORS was added to the example, to facilitate permissioned React client access on:

localhost:3000

The React app is not included in this respository.

Instructions are forthcoming in early 2023.
